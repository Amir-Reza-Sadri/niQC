## Community Survey

We have developed a survey to get a sense of various types of QC/QA that is done in the neuroimaging community. We request you to respond to this survey, and try cover the "full life-cycle" of neuroimaging research, including but not limited to data collection, preprocessing, intermediate outputs and final results, and are requested to provide details into the various QC/QA processes they conduct in their projects. The SIG plans to analyze all the responses from the community to identify the challenges our community is facing, consolidate and review existing research, develop protocols, compile manuals, improve tools, and make recommendations for best practices.
