Various datasets related to niQC research will be linked here, such as ratings of public datasets, phantom images and examples for various artefacts in different modalities. These datasets would be useful for various applications, including but not limited to
 - developing automatic detection techniques of artefacts and "bad scans"
 - developing image quality metrics and improving them based on public QC ratings
 - developing phantom QA protocols and harmonization across different scanners


If you are aware of a public dataset relevant to niQC, [**please send a pull request (PR) with the details**](https://github.com/INCF/niQC/pull/new/master), or [open an issue](https://github.com/INCF/niQC/issues/new) at the [niQC repo](https://github.com/INCF/niQC). *Thank you for your contribution*.
